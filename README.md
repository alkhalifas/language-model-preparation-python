# Training Language Models using Python

### What is a language model?

We can define a language model as a probability distribution over a given set of words.

### What are language models used for?

Language models are used across many facets of NLP tasks such as:
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Text Generation
- Text Classification
- ...

### What are the different types of language models:

We can think of language models falling into two main categories:
1. Statistical language models - Models that utilize traditional statistical approaches such as N-Gram or hidden markov models.
2. Neural language models - Models that utilize deep neural networks to model languages

### In this tutorial, we will cover three applications of language models:
1. N-Gram Language Model
2. Neural Language Model
3. Transformer Language Model
